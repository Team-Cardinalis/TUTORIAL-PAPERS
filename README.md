# TUTORIAL-PAPERS

A collection of technical notes describing key 2D neural network operations. As said just before, right there will be consigned our TUTORIAL-PAPERS, which aim to help AI and tech enjoyers understand this difficult process which is neural network.

Trying to make a light but detailed paper. Which everyone can be able to read, and most importantly, free access to this knowledge.

Each one of them will be axed on a precise filter into a neural network. Explaining to them the precise working of each one.

In a second hand, we pursue our dream to enhance even more what AI reach. We aspire to push it far beyond and keep researching this gigantic field, to keep improving our capacity and knowledge


## Table of Contents

### Computer Vision :
Here are all the different filters of computer vision that our TUTORIAL PAPERS will talk about. Based on many different mathematical equations to refine our data.
Computer Vision is a field of AI that enables computers and systems to see, interpret, and understand visual informations.

   Overview of the 2D convolution layer: principles, mathematical formulation, implementation details, and visual examples.

[CONVTRANSPOSE2D.md](CONVTRANSPOSE2D.md)  
   2D transposed convolution (deconvolution): mechanism, applications in generative architectures, and detailed examples.

[AVGPOOL2D.md](AVGPOOL2D.md)  
   2D average pooling: concept, equations, effect on feature maps, and common use cases.

[ADAPTIVEAVGPOOL2D.md](ADAPTIVEAVGPOOL2D.md)
